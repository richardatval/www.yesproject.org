# Help

## 1. Overview

Welcome to the {{ site.title }} help system.

## 2. How to edit a page or post

The {{ site.title }} website is basically a collection of text files and images which 'talk to each other'.

A program called Jekyll takes these text files and builds them into a website. So for the most part all editing is simply a case of editing these files.

## 3. How to create a new post

You can begin editing the site by visiting the admin pages:

[{{ site.url }}/admin]({{ site.url }}/admin)

This will redirect you the editor.

The YES Project has launched a new enterprise course for 15-24-year olds called Social Boost.

Social Boost is a three-month programme that will teach unemployed young people how to use social media professionally and set up their own social media business.

During their time on Social Boost the young people will learn how to use different social media platforms, how to build and engage followers and how to create good content.  They'll also develop sales and entrepreneurial skills through pitching to a local business to manage its social media platforms, 

Ricky Shah, who runs his own company Accelerate Yourself, where he manages social media platforms for business and heads up YES Enterprise will be mentoring the young people throughout the programme. 
He comments;

> "Social Boost is a fantastic opportunity for local unemployed young people to learn how to make money from social media.  

> With so many young people already using social media as part of their day to day lives, this programme will teach them how they can build a career and earn an income from using the platforms.

> I will be working closely and supporting the young people throughout the course. I've already had lots of interest from local businesses that are willing to work with young person on YES Enterprise."

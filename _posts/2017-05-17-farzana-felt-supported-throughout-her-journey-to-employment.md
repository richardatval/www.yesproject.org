After graduating from University Farzana felt lost, she did not know what direction she wanted her life to go and the university was not providing any support.

She started applying for paid work but due to her lack of work experience she was not getting job interviews, so was looking for work experience opportunities.

Farzana was aware of the services offered at BYCS as it has been a community organisation for many years.  She met with the YES Project Officer who suggested she carry out voluntary work to gain experience.

She completed 4 months’ voluntary work as a classroom assistant and says it helped her improve self-confidence and motivation. 

Farzana, age 22 comments about BYSC and YES Project

> “BYCS helped me to undertake one to one job search. I found the advert for my job and the YES Project Advisor encouraged me to consider and apply for this role. I was given practical interview technique sessions to help me improve my skills. I felt reassured that someone was there for me throughout my journey to employment. “

Farzana now works as a Health Trainer, Packwood Healthcare Ltd

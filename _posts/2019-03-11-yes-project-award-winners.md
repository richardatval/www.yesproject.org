![YES Awards Winner Alex](/img/awards/main.jpg)

Alex was named the winner of the Young Person of the Year award,  nominated by The Bridge East Midlands.
Alex wanted support with motivation, confidence building and dealing with his anxiety. Before starting YES Project, Alex wouldn’t leave the house, avoided family gatherings and holidays as his anxiety was too much. With his keyworker, Alex undertook small tasks to build up his confidence such as going into town for the first time in three years. Alex went on to complete the Engage course at Twenty Twenty and is currently on the J2W course. Through The Bridge and YES Project Alex passed his theory test, takes the bus into town by himself and attend Leicester football matches with his dad.
 
Speaking of the event, YES Project Executive Manager, Vandna Gohil said:
<blockquote>It was a great event that celebrates the achievements of young people and the progression they’ve made towards education, employment and training - truly heart-warming and inspiring.</blockquote>

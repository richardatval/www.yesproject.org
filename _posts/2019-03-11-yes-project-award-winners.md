The YES Project Awards were held on Monday 18th February 2019 at Hansom Hall in Leicester to celebrate the achievements of its young participants aged 15-24. 

It proved to be an inspiring afternoon hearing the award winners’ journeys; the barriers they’ve overcome, their achievements and plans for the future.  The award winners were decided by each of the 

YES Projects Delivery Partners.
Speaking of the event, YES Project Executive Manager, Vandna Gohil said:

<blockquote>It was a great event that celebrates the achievements of young people and the progression they’ve made towards education, employment and training - truly heart-warming and inspiring.</blockquote>

### Young Person of the Year

The overall “Young Person of the Year” was awarded to Alex, nominated by The Bridge East Midlands.

Alex wanted support with motivation, confidence building and dealing with his anxiety. Before starting YES Project, Alex wouldn’t leave the house, avoided family gatherings and holidays as his anxiety was too much. With his keyworker, Alex undertook small tasks to build up his confidence such as going into town for the first time in three years. Alex went on to complete the Engage programme at Twenty Twenty and is currently on the J2W course. Through The Bridge and YES Project Alex passed his theory test, takes the bus into town by himself and attends Leicester football matches with his dad.

#### Rhys

Rhys was nominated by delivery partner, The Prince’s Trust. Before starting the YES Project, Rhys was terrified of identifying as Transgender to new employers and whether they’d be accepting and accommodating. Rhys enrolled on the M&S Get into Retail programme to learn practical work experience as well as employability and interview skills. He excelled on the course and found the programme to be supportive and respectful. Rhys was successful in securing a 12 week, 16 hour contract with M&S.

#### Martin

Martin initially found it difficult to express his goals for the future and how he would achieve them. By joining the YES Project he was able to work closely with his keyworker to set realistic goals. Martin performed remarkably on his work experience at HMV that they offered him an employed position. This gave Martin an enormous self confidence boost and Martin realised he had the skills to thrive in the working world.

#### Sophie

The YES Project has helped young people to take steps towards employment, training and education by offering a range of courses and tailored support to meet individual needs. Working closely with its young participants, the YES Project encourages them to achieve their goals and see a brighter future. 

A partnership of organisations and charities from across Leicester and Leicestershire, the YES Project is managed by Voluntary Action LeicesterShire. 

One YES Project participant reflects on her time with the Project: 

> “I’m really proud that I got a job. I feel that I’ve pushed myself and am ready for the next chapter.”

Supporting 427 young people since its commencement in July 2016, the Project has already hit its lifetime target. To date, the YES Project has helped 128 young people to obtain employment, with a further 71 moving into further education or training.

Abdul Asghar, YES Team Manager said: 

> “The YES Project had been immensely successful and we’re delighted to hit our overall lifetime target. Helping over 400 young people from across Leicestershire is a great achievement, we’re delighted that so many of our participants have found employed roles since exiting the Project.”

The current YES Project continues to offer one-to one support to its current participants to the end of October 2019.

The YES Project is funded by the European Social Fund and The National Lottery Community Fund.

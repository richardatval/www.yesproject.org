Before joining the YES Project, Daniel was at home everyday wandering where life would go. Daniel realised he needed to improve his confidence, motivation and self-worth to move forward.
. 
Daniel reflects on how he felt before joining the YES Project, he said:

> “I acknowledged that I had a lot of room to grow and I wanted to get a feeling of meaning back in to my life.”

Daniel accessed support from several delivery partners; YES Media with Seed, Warwickshire College Team Programme, World of Work Tour with Leicestershire Cares and The Bridge East Midlands. 

This combination of support and programme access made Daniel more confident to leave the house and feel independent. He started to develop a routine, preventing him from falling in to a familiar slump. Daniel found the one-to-one support he received invaluable from the delivery partners he accessed and his YES key worker. 

Daniel comments:

> “My keyworker provided continual support that stopped me from giving up hope. In turn, I didn’t want to let her down as we’d built up a lot of trust.”

Daniel is now completing his Level 2 Maths qualification and plans to start a Further Education course in media with the goal of obtaining employment within the creative industry. 

Summing up his time on the YES Project and how much he’s grown, Daniel said:

> “I’ve always had a strong disbelief in myself and it’s been amazing to hear time and time again that I’m continuing to improve. I found that being in a supportive environment has helped me to retain information and face my fears.”

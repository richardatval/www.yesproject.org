Reuben was studying a Mental Health Nursing degree at University; but realised that although he was interested in studying mental health, nursing wasn’t the direction he wanted to go. He left University and lived in Yorkshire, but after losing his job and a relationship breakdown, Reuben moved back home with his parents in Leicester.

Struggling with his mental health, Reuben would spend most of his time at home unsure of the next step. It was hard for Reuben after being independent for a long time but he didn’t feel ready for work so needed something to bridge gap and build his confidence. 

Reuben heard about the Prince’s Trust YES Team Programme but while waiting for a new programme to start, he side stepped onto YES Media through Seed. With the support of his key worker and YES Media leaders; Reuben grew in confidence often taking a leadership role within the group.

Reuben reflects on the YES Media course:
> “Media wasn’t something I’d considered before, I’d done it at GCSE and had a vague interest. This course was a good fit to help me get back to where I wanted to be. It helped me re-establish a routine and being in a social setting again. It gave me a feeling of pride and a sense of accomplishment.”

While at the YES Project, Reuben attended the LGBT centre and volunteered at the youth group. After leaving the YES Project he got more involved with volunteering at the centre and secured a job managing the Youth Trans Project.

When this project came to an end, Reuben was offered a job as Community Project Officer comprising of the Adult Trans Project and Youth Service. Reuben offers support and guidance, attends school assemblies and delivers training and workshops. Since taking on this role Reuben has also worked with the YES Project to offer awareness training to staff and provided one-to-one support to other participants.

Looking to inspire others to join the YES Project, Reuben said:
> “Do it! The YES Project helped me open the doors and reach my potential. The skills, tools and confidence were there but it would have taken a lot longer without the YES Project.” It’s not just myself, while on YES I saw growth in other young people too.”

Chris Gray from delivery partner Seed Creative, summed up the day:
<blockquote>
I feel very proud to be part of the YES project when I heard about how so many of those young people had overcome significant barriers and are now either in employment or full-time education. The YES Project celebration event hammered home to me the need for projects, such as these, to exist and for us to ensure that young people who are feeling lost and vulnerable receive the support that they need.</blockquote>
 
The YES Project is proud to offer support to young people in Leicester and Leicestershire, delivering a wide range of courses and tailored support to meet their individual needs.

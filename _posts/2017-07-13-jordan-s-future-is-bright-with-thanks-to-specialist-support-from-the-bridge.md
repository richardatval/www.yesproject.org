Ben (not pictured) was referred by the YES Project to The Bridge for specialist support as he has autism and suffers with anxiety and depression. 

The Bridge’s Intensive Young Person’s Support Worker Vickee Kainth, started to meet with Ben and his mum who would be present to support him. 

Initially Ben would only reply to Vickee with one word.  His confidence was extremely low and he would spend all of his time at home comparing himself to his educated brother. Vickee met regularly which helped Ben improve his confidence and she empowered him to take ownership of his support plan and identify his goals.

Through receiving support from The Bridge, Ben had an absence hearing to appeal his Personal Independence Payment (PIP) decision. Vickee supported him to submit all the evidence to the tribunal, this resulted in Ben being awarded PIP and he also received a backdated amount.
Ben was supported to attend the GP to obtain a gym pass and counselling to help improve his mental health and confidence. He also accessed one other delivery partner of The Yes Project, Soft Touch Arts, where Ben discovered that he liked to sing and he received support to produce his own music.

Ben and his mum also improved their communication through the support of mediation, which resulted in less arguments at home.

Ben went on to enrolling with a college to achieve his functional skills in Maths and English and he is now working towards achieving his GCSE’s. Upon leaving the Yes Project, Vickee referred Ben to the Social Inclusion Team at his college to ensure he is being provided support going forward.

> The YES Project has supported me in so many ways...I can take part in a range of activities such as creating music, graffiti and other arts and it also helped me to get back into the gym. It has helped me get my confidence back.

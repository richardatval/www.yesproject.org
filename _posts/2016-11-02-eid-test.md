What’s that rustle in the undergrowth? Is that a twitching of ears I can see in the distance?

### Easter Parade

That’s right, it’s that time of year again. The Easter Bunny will soon be making his rounds, and we very much look forward to welcoming him here. This year, we will be celebrating with an Easter Bonnet Parade for children 16 and under, as well as a competition for the grow-ups over the age of 16! Although keenly contested, this is always a fun event, with participants never failing to come up with stunning creations. Everyone’s a winner at this event, but we will be reserving special prizes for the best entries!

### Treasure Hunt

For intrepid explorers, there will also be the annual Easter Egg Hunt, which will be open to children aged 12 and under. Join the fun searching for our magical eggs near the Seed Hut, which can be exchanged for Creme Eggs!

### Raffle

To help us cover some of the cost of the fun, there will be a raffle, with Easter eggs, as well as anything else that you might donate, as prizes!

### Buffet

Festivities would not be festivities without a feast, but to help us make this happen we all have to pitch in together! Hot cross buns will be provided on the day by the Society, as will tea and coffee, but it would be wonderful if Members could bring along some extra nibbles – a few pork pies, hummus, or some sausage rolls never go amiss, and it’s always lovely to sample your homemade cakes, pickles, bread, and jams.

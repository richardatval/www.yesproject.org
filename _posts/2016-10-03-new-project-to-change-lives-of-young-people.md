We're pleased to announce that funding has been secured to launch a new project to support some of Leicester and Leicestershire's most at risk young people. The project, called the Youth Employability Support (YES) project, will aim to transform the futures of 400 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 who are currently the furthest from being able to move into employment.

It will focus on young people who face extra barriers to work, such as mental or physical health difficulties, homelessness, disabilities or being a carer, but it will also be open to any young person in Leicester or Leicestershire who is not in employment, education or training.

VAL Infrastructure Executive Manager Simon Jenner explained saying:

> This project has been developed over a period of more than a year alongside eight partners and the young people we'll be supporting. This means that the project will be able to deliver innovative, person-centred solutions based on what young people really need.

### A new approach

Unlike traditional services, the YES Project will deliver a bespoke journey for young people. YES Project staff will reach out to young people, assess their needs and then work with the young person to develop a support package that works for them.

Support on offer will include one to one mentoring, work places, creative short courses, team building and more.

These services will be delivered by the YES Project's eight delivery partners: The Prince's Trust, Seed Creativity, Soft Touch Arts, Twenty Twenty, Leicestershire Cares, Bangladesh Youth and Cultural Shomiti, The Bridge and Warwickshire College.

### Our funders

The project has received up to £1.9m of funding from the Big Lottery Fund and the European Social Fund as part of the 2014-2020 European Structural and Investment Funds Growth Programme in England. The Department for Work and Pensions is the Managing Authority for the England European Social Fund programme.

Established by the European Union, the European Social Fund helps local areas stimulate their economic development by investing in projects which will support skills development, employment and job creation, social inclusion and local community regenerations.

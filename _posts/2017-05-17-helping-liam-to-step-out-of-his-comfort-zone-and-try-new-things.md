Before joining the YES Project Liam had been a student at Brooksby College on an Animal welfare course.

He had finished his course and didn’t know what to do next.  His Grandma got in touch with Chris from Seed Creative Academy to ask if he could help Liam.

Liam enrolled on the first [YES Media](https://www.yesproject.org/what-you-can-do/experience-the-world-of-digital-media/) course in October 2016. Since completing the course last December Liam has been on the [YES Team programme](https://www.yesproject.org/what-you-can-do/get-motivated-to-succeed/), is a member of the [Youth Leadership Group](https://www.yesproject.org/what-you-can-do/lead-and-inspire-people-like-you/), has carried out work experience at Poundland and has partaken in [Flying Fish company tours](https://www.yesproject.org/what-you-can-do/explore-the-world-of-work/) at Sytner BMW and Ford and Slatter Truck Dealership.

The YES Project has helped Liam to build his confidence, take on new responsibilities and be more decisive rather than letting other make decisions for him.   

Liam, aged 22 says he likes to be busy and get out of the house. He is an active member of the YES Project and comments on his experience;

> “Before accessing the YES Project I didn’t really talk much or communicate to other.  The project has supported me to step out of my comfort zone and shell, on the YES Team final presentation I had to get up and talk in front of others, this is something I never thought I’d be able to do.”

Liam would encourage others to sign up for the YES Project as it’s enjoyable and gives young people a purpose and routine.

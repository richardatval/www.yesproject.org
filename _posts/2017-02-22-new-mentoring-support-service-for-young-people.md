Kickstart mentoring offers young people accessing the YES Project a mentor who will meet with them once a week for an hour over a minimum of 6 months.

The programme is a great opportunity for young people to invest in themselves by taking advantage of personalised one-to-one support from a local business person.

Soft Touch Arts who are running Kickstart have just finished training up 9 mentors ready to start working with local young people age 15-24.

Each Mentor has been selected because they care and want to make a difference in a young person's life. They also have personal experience of overcoming challenges in their lives and have the skills to support young people do so too.

Over the course of the programme the mentors will build up trust and use coaching techniques to support their young person to look at their goals and how they can achieve them.

They will also work with the young person to change their perspectives and take positive steps for the future, as well as learning practical skills such as CV writing and interview techniques.

Any young person wanting to access Kickstart mentoring will need to be motivated to work towards change and have identified some goals they would like support to work towards. 

They will also need to be willing to engage in a relationship based on two-way conversation and able to commit one hour a week to meet their mentor, along with extra time to work towards goals in their own time.

In October 2016 Gerard approached YES Project partners Flying Fish for help after his brother advised him of upcoming vacancies with a local fencing firm.  

Gerard expressed an interest in applying but needed to obtain a Construction Skills Certification Scheme (CSCS) card to do so.  All tradespeople working on a UK construction site require a CSCS card to prove they have had adequate training and qualifications to work on a building site.

Gerard agreed to prove his motivation and undertake a two-week mentored work placement at Saffron Hill Cemetery in exchange for support to get his CSCS card.

The placement went well with Gerard scoring excellent in all areas including attendance, time keeping, communication and team work.  Cemetery manager, Sam Whitfield commented

> “We are all very happy with the level of commitment shown by Gerard.  He would be an asset to any potential employer”.

Gerard also attended a YES Project company tour of Sytner BMW in November 2016.

After several practice tests and just missing out on a pass on his first test, Gerard passed the second time and gained his CSCS card.  He has now started his new career with his brother at Charnwood Fencing.

Gerard aged 18, commented about the YES Project

> “I’m grateful for the support I received to get my CSCS Card. Without this I wouldn’t have got my job. I’m really enjoying my work, I get to travel around the UK and my employer is going to put me through my NVQ to become a skilled worker”

title: Youth leadership group attends national skills show
---
On Thursday 17 November the YES Youth Leadership Group went to the UK’s largest careers event The Skills Show at the NEC in Birmingham.

The outing was an opportunity for the group to find out about careers and apprenticeships within a range of different industries.

During their time at the event they were able to explore a range of job-related skills in web design, carpentry, TV production, forensic science and telecommunications. As well as chat to employers about job opportunities, career advice and hints and tips for CV writing and interviews. There was also the opportunity to talk to skills advisors and to find out more about apprenticeships and traineeships.

Zuli Stannard, YES Youth Leadership Co-ordinator commented:

> "Many of the young people that join the YES Project find it difficult to decide what job or career path to take.  Attending The Skills Show was an ideal way for them to discover what carers are out there and to focus on the skills and experience they need to get a job in their chosen career."

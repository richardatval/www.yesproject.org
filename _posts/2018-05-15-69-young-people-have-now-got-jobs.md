69 young people that were the furthest from the job market last year are now all in employment thanks to the Youth Employability Support (YES) Project.
 
The YES Project provides specialist support to disadvantaged 15 -24-year olds to overcome barriers such as mental health problems, homelessness and substance abuse.
 
Launched just 18 months ago, the project has worked with over 250 disadvantaged young people from across the city and county and has exceeded its three-year target of getting 50 young people into work.
 
The success of the project is down to the intensive support provided to the young people accessing it. Each individual on the project has a bespoke support package tailored to their needs.
 
During their time on the project each young person accesses a variety of activities such as team building, creative courses, qualifications and work placements, all designed to equip them with the skills needed to get a job or move into further education.
 
Lee Miles, who left school with low levels of literacy and numeracy which badly affected his confidence, joined the YES Project last year. He is now working full time.
 
Lee praised the support he received;
 
> “The Support I have had from the YES Project has been amazing. Getting a full time job after a long period of being unemployed is all down to the help I have received from them”
 
Simon Jenner, Executive Manager at Voluntary Action Leicestershire, the organisation managing the project commented:

> “We are delighted for the 69 people that now have a job and another 38 people who have moved into further education.

> With still another 18 months left of the project, there’s lots of time to support many more disadvantaged 15-24 year olds and get them into employment.

> Our aim is to transform the futures of 400 local young people who are currently the furthest from being able to move into employment”
 
The £1.94m YES Project is funded by the European Social Fund and the National Lottery, through the Big Lottery Fund and managed by Voluntary Action Leicestershire. It works in partnership with eight local organisations who deliver the activities to the young people.
 
These partners are The Prince’s Trust, Seed Creativity, Soft Touch Arts, TwentyTwenty, Leicestershire Cares, Bangladesh Youth and Cultural Shomiti, The
Bridge and Warwickshire College.

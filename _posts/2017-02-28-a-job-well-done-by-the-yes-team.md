On Friday 24 February, the YES Team completed their community project at Eyres Monsell Community Centre.

The team of twelve aged 16-24 worked tirelessly for over a week to decorate the community room, tidy up the garden and build a compost system. 

The young people that are half way through the 12-week programme had to raise money to fund the community project. They raised £250 from a cake sale and sponsored run.  

Tracey Inchley, Eyres Monsell Community Centre Manager was thrilled that her project was chosen by the YES Team she commented: 

> “Last year our community room was damaged by a flood, we replaced the carpets but were unable to decorate.

> The room is used daily by a number of different groups so I wanted something warm, calm and relaxing.

> The garden needed tidying up and I wanted a compost system for our cook and eat lunch clubs.

> It’s amazing what the Yes Team have done for us and all for free.”

To get the jobs done efficiently the team split into small groups and assigned roles and responsibilities to each group.  

Jordan took on the role of team leader for the garden.  He managed three people within his group and commented:

> “I wanted to work on the garden as it was more hands on with lots of work to do.  I gave everyone within my a group a job that they had to get done.”

Chantelle has a keen interest in art, she worked with her colleague painting a canvas for each activity that takes place within the room. 

> “Painting the canvases took us 3 days and I really enjoyed it.  There is one for each of the activities from knitting to slimming.”

The community project is one part of YES Team 12-week personal development programme ran by The Princes Trust.   The programme is open to unemployed 16-24 year olds and focusses on building confidence, gaining new skills and meeting new people.

During the programme young people take part in an action packed residential, community project, work experience and develop their functional skills.

All of the young people that complete the YES Team Programme receive a Level 1 Prince’s Trust Certificate in Employment, Teamwork and Community Skills and a Level 1 BTEC Award in Personal and Social Development.

Demetrius aged 21 spoke of his experience of being on the YES Team programme:

> "I don’t usually like group situations but I’d been referred to the YES Team programme by the Job Centre. 

> I went along with an open mind and the first week I felt a bit hesitant whether it was right for me. I soon got to know everyone and I feel more confident and sociable.

> I’d now like to get a job in youth work and help to inspire young people.”

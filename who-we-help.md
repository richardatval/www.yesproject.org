#### We support young people age 15-24 years old to take steps towards employment

Our project team is made up of nine youth organisation and charities from across Leicester and Leicestershire. Together, we’re the YES Project. 

Our purpose is to support local young people to overcome challenges and barriers that have prevented them from finding a job or seeking further education. 

The YES Project is delivered by Voluntary Action LeicesterShire and funded by Big Lottery Fund and the European Social Fund.


### Who we help

We’re here to work with young people aged 15-24 years old who are not already in education, employment or training. 

We have a special focus on young people who may face barriers that may prevent them from finding a job. These barriers can be anything from mental or physical health difficulties, disabilities, substance abuse, previous offences or homelessness.

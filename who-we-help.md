### We can help you if you’re aged 15-24 years old and not in education, employment or training.

We provide mentoring and specialist support services to help you overcome barriers that are preventing you from getting a job. 

These barriers could include issues such as: 

* Low self-esteem and confidence
* Language and cultural barriers
* Mental health issues 
* Substance abuse
* Leaving care or in care
* Homelessness 
* Previous offenders

If you require any others types of support such as childcare, travel costs or other financial support then please let us know. 

We’ll do our best to eliminate any barriers you may face to access or stay involved with the YES Project.

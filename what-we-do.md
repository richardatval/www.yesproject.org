### At the Youth Employability Support (YES) Project, we support young people age 15-24 years old to take steps towards employment.

Our project team is made up of nine youth organisation and charities from across Leicester and Leicestershire. Together, weâ€™re the YES Project. 

Our purpose is to support local young people to overcome challenges and barriers that have prevented them from finding a job or seeking further education. 

Working together as the YES Project means we can offer a range of courses, and support services tailored to an individuals needs that will help them to:

1.	Believe in themselves
2.	Achieve qualifications and learn new skills
3.	Prepare for work

Everyone enrolled on the YES Project will be assigned a mentor who will support them throughout their journey and help them to achieve their goals.

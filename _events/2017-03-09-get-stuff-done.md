‘Get Stuff Done’ Wednesdays is a drop-in session for any young person already accessing support from the YES Project.

The session is for anyone that needs to access a phone or the internet to 'Get Stuff Done' such as calling HMRC, the Job Centre, gas or electric companies etc.

Or drop in to check your emails or Facebook accounts.

We will also go through CV’s; job searches and college applications for anyone that needs that extra support in this time.

There are no allocated time slots, just pop down anytime. If you have children, they can come along too. Snacks will be provided.

Get Stuff Done runs every Wednesday 10am - 2pm at Leicestershire Cares, 42 Tower Street, Leicester LE1 6WT

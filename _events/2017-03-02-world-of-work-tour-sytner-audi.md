Find out what it's like to work in the motor industry on a company tour of car dealership Audi Sytner.

The tour will give you an insight into how the car dealership operates and all the jobs roles involved from receptionist and sales to mechanics and administration.

You'll also take part in activities that will help prepare you for work covering areas such as communication, team building and timekeeping.

We recently took a group of young people on a tour of BMW Sytner, here's what they said:

Heather, aged 17, commented:
“I wanted to be a lifeguard, but the tour has made me realise I’d like to be a receptionist. I’m interested in people and I’d enjoy talking to customers.”

Tom, aged 17, started the day unsure on what job he would like to do, but after the tour he said:
“I’ve really liked seeing the cars and I’d definitely be interested in working in the car bodyshop, spray painting the cars.”

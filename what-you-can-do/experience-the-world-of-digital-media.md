### What’s in it for me? 

Over the course of nine weeks, you’ll learn about digital media while also improving your confidence, motivation and team working skills. The course is broken down into three steps:

#### Step 1: Introduction to Digital Media 

During this step you will be introduced to different digital media channels, how to create content and media production.  You’ll then create a short film on a topic of your choice.

#### Step 2: Work Experience 

With your film made, you’ll gain real-life experience by working with digital media professionals on a live project.  Working as a team, you will experience the full media process from client brief to end product.

#### Step 3: Employability Skills

The final step of the programme will focus on job applications, CV writing, interview skills and preparing you for work.

On completion of the programme you will receive mentoring and support into employment, further education or training.

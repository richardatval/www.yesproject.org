### What’s in it for me?

As a member of the Youth Leadership Group you’ll be involved in making decisions, generating ideas, inspiring others to join the YES Project and you’ll play a key role in helping to shape and manage the YES Project. 

You will meet regularly with the group and work as a team on YES Project activities, workshops and events. 

This is a great way to develop leadership, team working, communications, negotiation and decision-making skills. 

During your time on the group you will receive one-to-one support, volunteering, work experience and excursion opportunities. 

As part of the Leadership Group you will develop a range of new skills and achievements that you can showcase on your CV to potential employees.

Explore the world of work and get a taste for type of job you would like to do in the future by taking part in a tailor-made, personal programme which can include world of work tours, day job trials and mentored work placements.

### Mentored work placements

A work experience placement is a great way to find out what it is like to be employed and to see what type of job you would like to have.  

The Flying Fish team will find you a suitable work placement based on what you would like to do. A trained mentor within the placement business will get support throughout.

On completion, you will receive an achievement certificate and a reference to help enter the world of employment. You will then also have lots to talk about when it comes to interviews.

### World of work tours

A Company Tour will give you an insight into how a business operates and all the jobs roles involved.  Our tours include shops, factories, car dealerships, restaurants, hotels and much more.  

Every tour includes activities that will help prepare you for work covering areas such as communication, team building, timekeeping or a mock interview.

### Next Steps

You’ll also get support to take the next step towards employment or education with an application support service.  This includes help with job or college searches, completing application forms, CV’s, interview techniques and mock interviews.

### When can I get started?

Get in touch today if you're interested in mentored work placements and we'll find you a suitable work placement.

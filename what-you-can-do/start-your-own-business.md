### What’s in it for me?

YES Enterprise team offers a range of support to help you make your business idea a reality.

### Enterprise challenges

These team activities are your chance to understand whether or not enterprise is for you and what starting a business involves. You’ll have the opportunity to enhance your existing skills and find skills you never knew you had!

### One to one support

If you’re ready to move faster, we can help you accelerate your progress with bespoke help developing your business plan and accessing finance.
Business start up workshops

These workshops are your opportunity to explore new ideas and learn about how to set up your own business. They’ll cover key topics like getting your company structure right, marketing and sales.

### Test Trade Days

We’ll offer you the opportunity to test your product or service in the real world on our Test Trade days. These days will give you the opportunity to pick up valuable feedback and help improve your offer.

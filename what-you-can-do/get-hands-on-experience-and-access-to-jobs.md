### What’s in it for me?

You’ll develop your employability skills and undertake a hands-on work placement and training with a local employer and have access to real job opportunities. 

This programme called 'Get into' is 4-6 weeks long and during that time you will receive:

* Targeted skills training and experience including employability skills, sector specific skills and a work placement 
* Nationally recognised qualifications
* Training to improve your teamwork, reliability and communication skills
* Support to search for, gain and sustain a job

To give you the best chance of getting a job after the programme, the courses are in sectors where jobs are most likely to be available.

### When can I get started?

True to our roots, we are a friendly and diverse group at AALGS. From the very young children who come to ‘help’ their families with the digging, to our invaluably wise Members in their 90s who are still doing their bit, no matter what your experience of allotment gardening, there will be something here for you.

There are currently around 200 plots on our site, most of which are around 300 square yards in size, with a few 100 square yard ‘nursery’ plots for those who are just starting out, or those who would prefer a ‘back garden’ sized plot over a market garden sized one!

Our biggest let is currently held by the Saffron Acres Project, a wonderful community gardening venture aiming to increase understanding of healthy, locally-grown, fresh food, bringing people together and improving the environment along the way. Many of our Members volunteer at SAP – if you are interested in doing so too, take a look here.

As a community, we tend to congregate around the Seed Hut where we operate a small shop offering competitively priced seeds, fertilisers, bulbs and other related materials to our Members, along with plenty of advice on how to plant them when they need it. We sell tea, coffee and other refreshments here, and there is also a small library of gardening books to help you along on your endeavours. The Seed Hut is open at the weekend, and sometimes during the week in the summertime, depending on the good will of the lovely Members who volunteer to run it. 

We hold a variety of social events and competitions throughout the year, as well as taster events for those who are interested in taking a look around the site.
